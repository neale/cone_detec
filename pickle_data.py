'''
Gather all images and labels and save them to pickle file
Saved file is a list of RGB image arrays, for vehicle and non-vehicle

Make sure your data is organized in the following directory structure:

data
	non-vehicles
	vehicles

Where 'non-vehicles' and 'vehices' contains the image data from Udacity
Then, run the following from the command line:

find data/non-vehicles -name '*.png' > nv_files.txt
find data/vehicles -name '*.png' > v_files.txt
